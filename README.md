Memory Game

This is a simple memory game. I focused on using MCV structure and OO Design in Javascript. 
The organization pattern I decided to use is know as the Observation Pattern. I have One master 
controller which speaks to smaller controllers and tells them when to update and change their own views 
which is then reflected on the page.
